The Translator Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service (ICEES) is providing you with Data that have been de-identified in accordance with 45 C.F.R. §§ 164.514(a) and (b) and that the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) and UNC Health are permitted to provide under 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(d)(2). Recipient agrees to notify DILIN and UNC Health via the Renaissance Computing Institute in the event that Recipient receives any identifiable data in error and to take such measures to return the identifiable data and/or destroy it at the direction of UNC Health. Reipient confirms membership in the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium and agrees to restrict access to ICEES only to other fully-onboarded consortium members.

Recipient agrees to use appropriate safeguards to protect the Data from misuse and unauthorized access or disclosure. Recipient will report to UNCHCS any unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of the Data not provided for by the Service of which Recipient becomes aware.
